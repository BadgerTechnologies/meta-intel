The intel-* BSPs, also known as the intel-common BSPs, provide a few
carefully selected tune options and generic hardware support to cover
the majority of current Intel CPUs and devices. The naming follows the
convention of intel-<TUNE>-<BITS>, where TUNE is the gcc cpu-type (used
with mtune and march typically) and BITS is either 32 bit or 64 bit.

intel-core2-32
This BSP is optimized for the Core2 family of CPUs as well as all Atom
CPUs prior to the Silvermont core.

intel-corei7-64
This BSP is optimized for Nehalem and later Core and Xeon CPUs as well
as Silvermont and later Atom CPUs, such as the Baytrail SoCs.

These BSPs use what we call the intel-common Linux kernel package
architecture. This includes core2-32-intel-common and
corei7-64-intel-common. These kernel packages can also be used by any of
the BSPs in meta-intel that choose to include the
intel-common-pkgarch.inc file. To minimize the proliferation of vendor
trees, reduce the sources we must support, and consolidate QA efforts,
all BSP maintainers are encouraged to make use of the intel-common Linux
kernel package architecture.

Of the BSPs presently included in meta-intel, the following have passed
initial testing with the intel-common BSPs (rather than the named BSP):

For intel-corei7-64:
    crystalforest-server
    crystalforest-gladden
    haswell-wc
    romley
    sugarbay

For intel-core2-32:
    <currently under test>

If you are interested in a BSP not listed here, chances are we are
currently working on resolving some configuration issues with it. Please
check the bugzilla and check in with us on the meta-intel mailing list.
